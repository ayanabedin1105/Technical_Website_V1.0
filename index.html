            Cells are the basic units that make up the human body. Cells grow and divide to make new cells as the body
            needs them. Usually, cells die when they get too old or damaged. Then, new cells take their place.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cancer begins when genetic changes interfere with this orderly process. Cells start to grow uncontrollably.
            These cells may form a mass called a tumor. A tumor can be cancerous or benign. A cancerous tumor is
            malignant, meaning it can grow and spread to other parts of the body. A benign tumor means the tumor can
            grow but will not spread.
          </p>
          <p>Some types of cancer do not form a tumor. These include leukemias, most types of lymphoma, and myeloma.</p>

          <p>Doctors divide cancer into types based on where it begins. Four main types of cancer are:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Carcinomas. </b>A carcinoma begins in the skin or the tissue that covers the surface of internal organs
              and glands. Carcinomas usually form solid tumors. They are the most common type of cancer. Examples of
              carcinomas include <b>prostate cancer</b>, <b>breast cancer</b>, <b>lung cancer</b>, and
              <b>colorectal cancer</b>.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <b>Sarcomas. </b>A sarcoma begins in the tissues that support and connect the body. A sarcoma can develop
              in fat, muscles, nerves, tendons, joints, blood vessels, lymph vessels, cartilage, or bone.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <b>Leukemias. </b>Leukemia is a cancer of the blood. Leukemia begins when healthy blood cells change and
              grow uncontrollably. The 4 main types of leukemia are <b>acute lymphocytic leukemia</b>,
              <b>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</b>, <b>acute myeloid leukemia</b>, and <b>chronic myeloid leukemia</b>.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <b>Lymphomas. </b>Lymphoma is a cancer that begins in the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is a
              network of vessels and glands that help fight infection. There are 2 main types of lymphomas:
              <b>Hodgkin lymphoma</b> and <b>non-Hodgkin lymphoma</b>.
            </li>
            <br />
          </ul>
          <p>
            There are many other types of cancer. Learn more about these

          <header>How Cancer Spreads</header>
          <p>
            As a cancerous tumor grows, the bloodstream or lymphatic system may carry cancer cells to other parts of the
            body. During this process, the cancer cells grow and may develop into new tumors. This is known as
            metastasis.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the first places a cancer often spreads is to the lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are tiny, bean-shaped
            organs that help fight infection. They are located in clusters in different parts of the body, such as the
            neck, groin area, and under the arms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cancer may also spread through the bloodstream to distant parts of the body. These parts may include the
            bones, liver, lungs, or brain. Even if the cancer spreads, it is still named for the area where it began.
            For example, if breast cancer spreads to the lungs, it is called metastatic breast cancer, not lung cancer.

          <p>
            Often, a diagnosis begins when a person visits a doctor about an unusual symptom. The doctor will talk with
            the person about his or her medical history and symptoms. Then the doctor will do various tests to find out
            the cause of these symptoms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes a doctor finds cancer after a screening test in an otherwise healthy person. Examples of screening
            tests include colonoscopy, mammography, and a Pap test. A person may need more tests to confirm or disprove
            the result of the screening test.
          </p>
          <p>
            For most cancers, a biopsy is the only way to make a definite diagnosis. A biopsy is the removal of a small
            amount of tissue for further study. Learn more about making a diagnosis after a biopsy.

        <section class="main-section" id="Stages">

          <ul>
            <p>
              Staging is a way to describe a cancer. The cancer's stage tells you where a cancer is located and its
              size, how far it has grown into nearby tissues, and if it has spread to nearby lymph nodes or other parts
              of the body. Before starting any cancer treatment, doctors may use physical exams, imaging scans, and
              other tests to determine a cancer's stage. Staging may not be completed until all the tests are finished.
            </p>

            <p>
              Staging of a cancer can be done at different times in a person's medical care. Here are some information
              on when and how staging is done. You will notice that these descriptions refer to the "TNM category." This
              refers to the TNM system of cancer staging, which is explained in more detail further in this article.
            </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                <b>Clinical staging. </b>Clinical staging is staging that is done before any treatment begins. Your
                doctor uses information from physical exams, your medical history, and any x-rays, imaging, scans, or
                diagnostic tests that you had. They will also use the results of any biopsy that has been done of the
                cancer, lymph nodes, or other tissue. Clinical staging helps you and your doctor plan the initial steps
                in your treatment. Clinical staging is indicated with a small "c" before the TNM category.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <b>Pathological staging. </b>Pathological staging is based on the same information as clinical staging,
                plus any new information gained during surgery if surgery was the first treatment for the cancer.
                Pathological staging is indicated with a small "p" before the TNM category.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <b>Post-therapy staging. </b>Post-therapy staging is used in cases where surgery is not the first
                treatment, but other treatments are given before surgery. These treatments can include radiation therapy
                or drug treatments like chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or hormone therapy. These treatments may be used
                before surgery to shrink the tumor to make surgery easier. It can also help doctors learn how well
                treatments work for the cancer to plan further treatment. Post-therapy staging is indicated with a "y"
                before the TNM category.
              </p>
            </li>
            
          </ul>
          <p>
            When doctors determine the stage of the cancer using the TNM system, every cancer should be staged with
            clinical staging. After surgery or initial treatments before surgery, pathological staging and
            post-therapy staging should be used as well. Clinical staging is very important to help plan initial
            treatment, but pathological staging or post-therapy staging give the most information. This can help your
            health care team understand your prognosis.
